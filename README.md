# searcher cookbook
Follow on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tripolious) for updates  

The cookbook is a collection of usefully scripts, functions, smart contracts, helpers, tips and bots for golang searchers.

I will try to cover most of the topics you need to know as a searcher.  
Don't expect the bots I will share over time to make you rich, as I will only start sharing older versions of it.  
Still, if you follow up and understand the basics I'm pretty sure you will find your own alpha.

All in all you need to love competitive games to stay up with all the excellent searchers out there.

# Bonus
I will release packages I use in my bots or scripts that will help you in different areas

- [funcsig-search](https://github.com/tripolious/funcsig-search) - search for specific function signatures

### To be continued
After I finished the topics from above I will probably start sharing some other strats and bots.  
Please let me know in what topics your interested the most.

### Why do you share all this information?
I know that most of the searchers keep their findings and learnings as a secrete, still I think we need more devs in the market to push crypto.    
As a searcher you will get in touch and need to learn nearly everything about crypto.  
Flashbots did an amazing job, and so I want to contribute back.
